* ##### Recommended Path: Asynchronous JavaScript

  *Phew!* We just learned a lot about Node's deep internals! More than most developers ever learn! Our understanding of how Node works under the covers will give us a leg up in the more practical coding sections of the course that are coming up. Before we apply what we've learned, because some students taking the course have more experience with asynchronous JavaScript, we have 2 paths to pick from to accommodate everyone:

  \1. If you aren't too familiar with the latest asynchronous JavaScript features, head on over to **Appendix: Asynchronous JavaScript** to get familiar with how what we've learned applies to JavaScript code. Once you are done with that section, come back here and continue with the course!

  \2. If you have already worked extensively with asynchronous Javascript, Promises, and async / await, you can **ignore** the Appendix: Asynchronous JavaScript section and head on over to the next section where we learn how to use Node modules!

* [Latest Version of CSV Parser

  

  ***Heads up!\*** The latest version of the csv-parse package made a small change in how it exports the `parse` function.

  We will now need to replace the code below:

  ```
  const parse = require('csv-parse');
  ```

  And instead pick out the parse function from the exported object, by *destructuring* it like so:

  ```
  const { parse } = require('csv-parse');
  ```

  Everything else stays the same!

* [Exercise: Same Origin Policy

  

  **Let's test our knowledge of the browser's Same Origin Policy!** See if you can answer three quick questions about the following scenario:

  Say you're browsing a page on www.wikipedia.org. In general, will the following requests succeed, or fail?

  \1. A JavaScript `GET` request to www.bank.com.

  \2. A JavaScript `POST` request to www.bank.com.

  \3. Clicking an HTML link to a video on www.bank.com.

  

  *Scroll down to see the answers...*

  

  **Here we go!** There are possible exceptions, but in general the following will be true:

  \1. This request will *FAIL*, because requests to get information from a cross-origin domain are not allowed by the browser. The browser is trying to protect your privacy by preventing www.wikipedia.org from stealing your private information from www.bank.com.

  \2. This request will *SUCCEED*. This is a little known exception to the Same Origin Policy! The decision to allow `POST` requests is mostly historical, but there is also a lower chance that a `POST` request will steal your private information. `POST` requests are used to write data to a server, rather than `GET` data from it, so it's less likely the response will contain private information.

  \3. This request will *SUCCEED*. The Same Origin Policy applies only to scripts and not static resources like HTML tags.]

  *Heads up!* If you're using the default Windows shell, the syntax to set an environment variable like `PORT` is slightly different than what we saw in the previous video. To set `PORT` in your *package.json* on Windows, you'll want to write:

  ```
  "start": "set PORT=5000&& node src/server.js"
  ```

  Instead of:

  ```
  "start": "PORT=5000 node src/server.js"
  ```

  Alternatively, there's the [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env) NPM package which will work all platforms. Both options work!]

* [Common Issues With NPM Scripts

  

  *Heads up!* On Windows, the `npm run watch` command *may* not start both your client and server, depending on your shell. To solve this:

  1. You can use an NPM package like [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently) or [npm-run-all](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-run-all) instead of the & symbol in the `npm run watch` command.
  2. Or if you have the **bash** shell installed on your machine (for example, through Git for Windows), set the default shell used by NPM to the bash shell by typing: `npm config set script-shell bash` in your terminal. All commands in your *package.json* will now run in a bash shell.
  3. 

  If you're having issues with the `npm install` command:

  1. Try removing *package-lock.json* in both the server/ and client/ folders.
  2. Try updating to a version of Node greater than 16 with an NPM version greater than 7.11. There is a bug in previous versions of NPM that prevents the `--prefix` parameter from working correctly.

  

  What we're working with here is automation and specifically *DevOps*, which is often a dedicated role when working in a larger team of developers. It takes lots of practice and patience to get right!]

* [Setting BUILD_PATH On Windows

  

  *Friendly reminder!* BUILD_PATH is an environment variable, just like PORT. On Windows, with the default shell, the way we set our BUILD_PATH variable is:

  ```
  set BUILD_PATH=../server/public&& react-scripts build
  ```

  Rather than the `bash` version:

  ```
  BUILD_PATH=../server/public react-scripts build
  ```

### Databases

* [Introduction to Databases](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/9WvHhppjS5WmzvBPcmfZ)

* [Recommended Path: SQL

  

  This is exciting! In the next videos we're going to explore two main categories of databases: SQL and NoSQL and choose which one to use for our project. Because our students come from all kinds of different backgrounds, we've provided some additional material on SQL databases.

  If you aren't familiar with databases, or haven't used SQL databases before, jump over to the **Appendix: SQL** section. In this section you'll get a strong foundation in SQL databases. This knowledge will help you make the decision on which database to use *together with us* in the next videos!

  Otherwise, let's continue with our comparison of NoSQL with SQL!]

* [Connecting with the Latest Version of Mongoose

  

  *Heads up!* If you've installed the latest version of Mongoose (version 6 and higher), you can save yourself a few lines of code!

  Mongoose now uses the best possible options in the MongoDB driver by default. Instead of connecting to Mongo like so:

  ```
     await mongoose.connect(MONGO_URL, {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useFindAndModify: false,
      useCreateIndex: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
  ```

  You now only need to pass in the URL, like so:

  ```
  await mongoose.connect(MONGO_URL);
  ```

  The Mongoose team has improved their API and made our life a little bit easier. Good stuff!]

* [Aborting with the Latest MongoDB Driver

  

  *Heads up!* If you've installed the latest version of Mongoose (version 6 and higher), the developers have improved the naming of some properties. Because of this, the updateOne function will now give us a different response. 

  To ensure aborting a launch succeeds, we will need to replace:

  ```
  return aborted.ok === 1 && aborted.nModified === 1;
  ```

  In launches.model.js with the following:

  ```
  return aborted.modifiedCount === 1;
  ```

  Our abort functionality should now work as expected. And *we're all up to date! Hurray!*]
