### Introduction

* [Course Outline](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/Gp86dixARmygrsLaF9lx)

* ##### All Course Resources + Notebooks

  Throughout the course there will be various links to different resources, however, one will be your source of truth.

  The course GitHub repo: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning

  Inside you will find a "Course materials" table that contains all of the materials you'll need for the course, including:

  - **Lessons in code & text:** all videos are based on these notebooks, refer to them for code and text-based explanations of different deep learning and TensorFlow concepts.
  - **Lessons in code & text (from the videos):** notebooks containing the exact code we'll be writing together during the videos.
  - **Slides:** all slides and images used to explain different concepts throughout the course.
  - **Exercises & extra-curriculum:** each section comes with a series of challenges and extra resources to help you practice your skills and learn more.

  But possibly the most important out of all of the above will be the GitHub Discussions tab: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions

  If you have any questions, ideas, feedback or concerns, feel free to start a discussion thread, that way Daniel (the one writing this), Andrei and other students can read and offer help.

  Again, there will be more resources listed throughout the course but the GitHub repo will be the one-stop-shop for everything.

  Be sure to star it and add it to your bookmarks tab: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning

  Happy Deep Learning!

* ##### TensorFlow Fundamentals challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Massive effort on making it through the first section!

  By now you should have a high-level overview of what deep learning and neural networks are and what kind of problems they can be used for.

  And you should also be familiar with creating and manipulating tensors in TensorFlow. Because as you'll see later on, tensors are a fundamental component of representing and finding patterns in data.

  Before moving onto the next section, it's time to practice your skills!

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  By going through these, you'll cement your foundational knowledge of deep learning and TensorFlow and be ready to start building neural networks of your own.

  See the link below for more.

  - [TensorFlow and Deep Learning Fundamentals Exercises & Extra-curriculum](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning#-00-tensorflow-fundamentals-exercises)

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** What are 3 of your favourite use cases for deep learning (you can use examples from the videos or feel free to look some up)?

  Send a message with your answer(s) to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to hear them!

### Neural network regression with TensorFlow

* [Introduction to Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/0OIytCaRYKTQLfs5WPwc)

* [Creating sample regression data (so we can model it)](https://cdn.fs.teachablecdn.com/fTxc2q7nTm64DuxO778z)

* ##### Note: Code update for upcoming lecture(s) for TensorFlow 2.7.0+ fix

  In November 2021, TensorFlow released [TensorFlow 2.7.0](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/releases/tag/v2.7.0).

  It's now the default version of TensorFlow in Google Colab.

  And you might find it breaks the code that's running in the upcoming lectures.

  No worries though.

  We can fix it.

  ##### Error

  You might see this error:

  ```
  ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer "sequential" (type Sequential).
      
      Input 0 of layer "dense" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=2, found ndim=1. Full shape received: (None,)
      
      Call arguments received:
        • inputs=tf.Tensor(shape=(None,), dtype=float32)
        • training=True
        • mask=None
  ```

  This happens because `model.fit()` no longer automatically upscales inputs from shape `(batch_size, )` to `(batch_size, 1)`.

  This results in a **shape error** (remember one of most common errors in deep learning is input and output shapes).

  To fix this, you can update the shape.

  ##### Fix

  If you're running TensorFlow 2.7.0+ and you're passing a vector to a model, you need to expand its dimensions.

  ```
  ## OLD
  # Fit the model
  model.fit(X, y, epochs=5) # this will break with TensorFlow 2.7.0+
  
  ## New
  # Fit the model
  model.fit(tf.expand_dims(X, axis=-1), y, epochs=5) # <- updated line
  ```

  The code adds an extra dimension to `X` on the last axis, turning it `ndim=1` to `ndim=2` (what the model requires).

  To see a full explanation of this refer to the following:

* ##### TensorFlow Regression challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Ho, ho, look at you go! You’ve already built your first neural networks with TensorFlow!

  Massive effort making it through neural network regression with TensorFlow.

  By now you should be able to describe what a regression problem is and put together different TensorFlow modules to be able to build a model which attempts to solve that problem.

  It’s that time again, time to put your new skills to work.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  By going through these, you'll get more hands-on practice building neural networks and start to understand what goes on behind the scenes.

  See the link below for more.

  - [Neural Network Regression with TensorFlow Exercises & Extra-curriculum](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/README.md#-01-neural-network-regression-with-tensorflow-exercises)

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** Think of a regression problem you’ve come into contact with before, what it is? If you were going to build a neural network to solve it, what would the inputs be? What would the ideal outputs be?

* ##### Note: Updates for TensorFlow 2.7.0

  A quick note on the next couple of videos.

  If you're using TensorFlow 2.7.0+ (default in Google Colab from November 2021), you might run into some shape errors when trying to fit a model (calling `model.fit()`).

  This happened due to some changes in TensorFlow 2.7.0.

  In short, TensorFlow no longer automatically upranks single dimension data from `(batch_size, )` to `(batch_size, 1)`.

  This is fine because it can be fixed with a couple of lines of code.

  ##### Error

  You might see this error when trying to fit `model_3` :

  ```
  ValueError: Exception encountered when calling layer "sequential_2" (type Sequential).
  Input 0 of layer "dense" is incompatible with the layer: expected min_ndim=2, found ndim=1. Full shape received: (None,)
  ```

  This is a shape error, one of the most common in deep learning and you should expect to get more of them.

  ##### Fix (for next video)

  To fix this, when creating the `model_3`, define the `input_shape` parameter of the first layer (this tells the model what shape of the data it should be expecting.

  ```
  # Set random seed
  tf.random.set_seed(42)
  
  # 1. Create the model (this time 3 layers)
  model_3 = tf.keras.Sequential([
    ## Before TensorFlow 2.7.0
    # tf.keras.layers.Dense(100), # add 100 dense neurons
  
    ## After TensorFlow 2.7.0
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(100, input_shape=(None, 1)), # <- define input_shape here
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10), # add another layer with 10 neurons
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
  ])
  
  # 2. Compile the model
  model_3.compile(loss=tf.keras.losses.BinaryCrossentropy(),
                  optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), # use Adam instead of SGD
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```

  And then when fitting the model, expand the dimensions of the input data.

  ```
  # Set random seed
  tf.random.set_seed(42)
  
  # Create some regression data
  X_regression = np.arange(0, 1000, 5)
  y_regression = np.arange(100, 1100, 5)
  
  # Split it into training and test sets
  X_reg_train = X_regression[:150]
  X_reg_test = X_regression[150:]
  y_reg_train = y_regression[:150]
  y_reg_test = y_regression[150:]
  
  # Fit our model to the data
  
  ## Note: Before TensorFlow 2.7.0, this line would work
  # model_3.fit(X_reg_train, y_reg_train, epochs=100) # <- this will error in TensorFlow 2.7.0+
  
  ## After TensorFlow 2.7.0
  model_3.fit(tf.expand_dims(X_reg_train, axis=-1), # <- expand input dimensions
              y_reg_train,
              epochs=100)
  ```

  These two fixes should get your model working as usual.

* ##### TensorFlow classification challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Consider it classified!

  Well, not classified in the sense it’s a secret, classified in the sense you’ve now built nearly a dozen (did you count them all?) neural network classification models with TensorFlow!

  And on top of that, you learned about the power of non-linearity (non-straight lines), one of the key ingredients for neural networks to find patterns in non-linear (non-straight) data.

  By now you should be able to:

  - Describe what a classification problem is
  - Describe the input and output shapes of a classification problem
  - Build a neural network in TensorFlow to solve binary and multi-class classification problems

  The videos contained a bunch of information about the above but now it’s time to practice your skills.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course Materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  I’d recommend going through these **before** moving onto the next module.

  Because although the videos may be teaching you a lot, nothing will teach you more than writing more code.

  See the link below for more.

  - [Neural Network Classification with TensorFlow Exercises & Extra-curriculum](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/blob/main/README.md#-02-neural-network-classification-with-tensorflow-exercises)

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** Think of a classification problem you’d like to work on. What are the input shapes (and information to feed to your model)? What are the ideal output shapes (what should your model classify)? Can you find an existing example of this problem online?

  Send a message with your answer(s) to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to hear them!

* ##### TensorFlow computer vision and CNNs challenge, exercises & extra-curriculum

  Boom boom! You’ve just taught a computer to see the world leveraging the power of Convolutional Neural Networks and TensorFlow!

  These are the same kind of models powering use cases such as Tesla’s self-driving cars.

  How cool is that?

  You also learned how to import and preprocess some of your own custom images to predict on (because after all, that’s what we want to do with our models, use them on data outside of our notebooks).

  Specifically, you should be able to:

  - Describe different computer vision problems
  - Load and preprocess data for computer vision problems with TensorFlow
  - Build a convolutional neural network with convolutional and max pooling layers for binary and multi-class image classification
  - Save and load trained TensorFlow model

  In other words, you learned a whole bunch.

  But before heading on to learn more, you should practice what you’ve learned.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course Materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  Going through these will help you understand what’s happening within the Convolutional Neural Networks you’ve built and in turn, will help you build better models in the future.

  See the link below for more.

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** What’s a problem you think computer vision could be used for? It could be anything (existing or new)!

  Send a message with your answer(s) to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to hear them!

  Holy smokes! We just wiped the floor with all of our previous models' thanks to the power of transfer learning.

  I hope you’re now starting to recognise the power of transfer learning and its advantages over building models from scratch all the time.

  We’re now well on our way to building a state of the art computer vision model for our Food Vision 🍔👁 problem.

  You should now be able to:

  - Describe the advantages of transfer learning
  - Preprocess image data to be able to be used with a transfer learning model
  - Navigate TensorFlow Hub in search of different pre-trained models for various problem spaces
  - Use a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub computer vision model

  Ready to practice?

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  TensorFlow Hub and the space of pre-trained models is vast. So practising writing more code will help you to identify when you can use a pre-trained model and when you might want to build something from scratch.

  See the link below for more.

  And remember, if you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  **Challenge:** Create a binary image classification dataset (with 10 images of any two classes, e.g. car vs. truck) and use a pre-trained TensorFlow Hub image classification model to classify them. How does it go?

  Send a message with picture(s) of your results to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke), I’d love to see them!

  Yes! Massive effort!

  You just went through a bunch of incredibly helpful steps for evaluating a model's performance.

  In particular, finding out where a model's predictions are the *most* wrong.

  And once again, you lived up to the machine learning practitioner's motto!

  “Experiment, experiment, experiment!”

  You should now be able to:

  - Discover your model's performance per class
  - Evaluate your model's most wrong predictions (by visualizing the samples where a model's prediction probability is high but the output label is wrong)
  - Make predictions on your own custom images/data with a trained model

  As always, it's time to practice your new skills.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  You should go through these **before** moving on to the next section.

* ##### Note: Mixed Precision producing errors for TensorFlow 2.5+

  Hey there,

  Just putting this note here to let you know that you may face an error in the next video if you're using TensorFlow 2.5+.

  **Error**

  The error happens when you turn on mixed precision training for EfficientNetBX models (if you're not sure what this is, you'll see it in the next video).

  It'll look something like this:

  ```
  TypeError: Input 'y' of 'Sub' Op has type float16 that does not match type float32 of argument 'x'
  ```

  As of **29 May 2021** it looks like this is a bug in TensorFlow 2.5+.

  There is an issue thread tracking the progress of an update on GitHub: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/49725

  **How to fix it**

  The current workaround is to downgrade to TensorFlow 2.4.1 (the last version before 2.5).

  You can do this in Google Colab by running:

  ```
  # Downgrade Tensorflow Version (run this in Google Colab) 
  !pip install tensorflow==2.4.1
  ```

  After doing so, you'll have to **restart your runtime** (Runtime -> Restart runtime) to ensure TensorFlow 2.4.1 is active.

  ```
  import tensorflow as tf
  tf.__version__
   
  >>> '2.4.1'
  ```

  Once TensorFlow 2.4.1 is installed, the code should work as normal.

  Ashik has also posted this on the course GitHub discussions: https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions/82

  If you have any issues, please post your question/reply there so others can see.

  If a fix for this issue comes for TensorFlow 2.5+ (it should), we'll update/remove this post.

  Happy mixed precision training,

  How'd you go?

  Did you make it through?

  Did you manage to train a model to beat the DeepFood paper?

  If you did, congratulations!

  Experimenting and figuring things out for yourself is a valuable skill in the world of machine learning (and software development in general).

  You should now be able to:

  - Use TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS) to download a ready-made (already in tensors) dataset
  - Preprocess your data to be used with a model (make sure all the data types are correct)
  - Create efficient data pipelines using `tf.data` API methods like `batch()` and `prefetch()`

  If you went through the Milestone Project 1 Template, you've already done plenty of practice but if you're up for it (I think you are), there's more.

### NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow

* ##### Welcome to natural language processing with TensorFlow!

  You're going to love this section.

  Natural language processing (NLP) is a very exciting technology that involves extracting information out of natural language.

  If this sounds quite broad, it's because it is.

  Imagine being able to:

  - Classify different kinds of Wikipedia articles
  - Generate new sequences of text (such as poems or blog posts)
  - Recognize speech from voice assistants

  Basically anywhere there's natural human language (speech or text), you can use NLP techniques.

  That's not all. Deep learning has changed the game over the last couple of years. It's now widely used across many different NLP tasks such as Search Engines, smart speakers, autocorrect (though it has some improvement to do here) and more.

  But that's enough for now, let's get into the materials.

  You can find the notebook for this section on GitHub.

* ##### NLP Fundamentals in TensorFlow challenge, exercises and extra-curriculum

  Look at that! Massive effort building neural networks with TensorFlow for natural language processing (NLP) data.

  You should now be able to:

  - Diagnose different kinds of NLP (and NLU) problems
  - Build recurrent neural networks for text data
  - Use TensorFlow Hub for pretrained text embeddings
  - Evaluate a model's most wrong predictions

  Before you move onto the next section, I'd encourage you to check out and work through the exercises and extra-curriculum.

  In the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”, you'll find a series of exercises and extra-curriculum suggestions.

  See the link below for more.

  If you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  Finally, before you move onto the next section, I've got a challenge for you.

  **Challenge:** Pick a Tweet from someone you follow on Twitter (can be about anything) as well as a Tweet about a disaster and run them both through the best performing model we trained in the notebook. Does the model predict the right classification (disaster or not disaster)?

  I'd love to see what you find.

* ##### Milestone Project 2 (SkimLit) challenge, exercises and extra-curriculum

  Woah!!! What a project and a half...

  Massive effort on making it all the way through!

  I hope now you're starting to realise the power of multi-modal models. Specifically, combining the inputs from different kinds of data sources (in our case, token embeddings as well as engineered features) and seeing how much of a performance boost they can give your models.

  I issued a big enough challenge in the last video (**going further with more data** and **finding SkimLit's most wrong predictions**).

  I'd encourage you to give both of those a go before moving onto the next module.

  As always, you can find the materials you'll need in the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”.

  If you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).

  Be sure to send a message to the #machinelearning-datascience channel on Discord and mention my name (@mrdbourke) of anything interesting you discover whilst learning more.

  Let's now move on to another common data type in machine learning: time series!

### **Time Series fundamentals in TensorFlow + Milestone Project 3: BitPredict**

* ##### Welcome to time series fundamentals with TensorFlow + Milestone Project 3!

  Are you ready for the biggest section of the course?

  Time series data has a few different things to think about when working with it (we'll see these in the upcoming video).

  But the skills you've learned so far will definitely still come into play.

  Time series problems deal with anything which has a **time component**.

  Think of:

  - Forecasting the stock price of Apple tomorrow given historical data
  - Predicting how much electricity a city will need next month based on the last 5-years of electricity demand
  - Analyzing ECG (heart monitor) data to detect whether or not a heartbeat is irregular or not

  If something has data over time, it can be considered a time series problem.

  Let's not wait around!

  I'm sure you're excited to get into things.

  In this section, we've combined time series fundamentals and Milestone Project 3 (BitPredict: predicting the price of Bitcoin) into one.

  As always you can find the full course materials on GitHub: https://www.github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/

  The specific notebook we're going to work through for the time series materials is also available as part of the course book: https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/10_time_series_forecasting_in_tensorflow/

* ##### TensorFlow Time Series Fundamentals Challenge and Extra Resources

  Massive effort on making it through the biggest module of the whole course!

  I warned you time series had a few tidbits to watch out for.

  But even with all of the videos and code you wrote, we're still just scratching the surface with time series.

  Saying this, I've prepared and collected a bunch of exercises and extra-curriculum resources you can use to test your skills and learn more.

  As always, you can find the materials you'll need in the [course GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning) under “Course materials”.

  And don't forget about the course book version of the materials for this section (it's nice and searchable): https://dev.mrdbourke.com/tensorflow-deep-learning/10_time_series_forecasting_in_tensorflow/

  If you have any questions, be sure to [add them to the discussions page](https://github.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/discussions).
